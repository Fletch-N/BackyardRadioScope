## Introduction
This repository is currently a space for brainstorming, researching, and developing ideas for the BackyardRadioScope project. The goal is to explore the feasibility and design of a small, software-directed radio telescope for amateur astronomy enthusiasts.

## Goals and Vision
This project aims to make radio astronomy accessible to hobbyists by developing a compact, software-directed radio telescope. The key goals and vision for the project include:

- **Compact Design**: Utilize a small array of directional antennas to reduce the physical space required for operation while maintaining effective resolution.
- **Beam Steering**: Implement beam steering technology to map the sky quickly and efficiently without relying on moving parts, unlike traditional dish or horn-based telescopes.
- **Accessibility**: Design the system to be affordable and user-friendly, making it accessible to amateur astronomers and hobbyists.
- **Full-Sky Mapping**: Enable the system to resolve the entire sky efficiently, providing a comprehensive view of space-based radio signals.
- **Citizen Science**: Enable users to publish time-coded datasets, allowing for collaborative data sharing. By synchronizing data from projects deployed far apart, the system can achieve higher resolution, effectively creating a virtual radio telescope with a baseline as large as the distance between the receivers.
